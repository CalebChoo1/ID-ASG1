This website is made to promote myself to companies when i am looking for a job in the future. It will contain information about me, my certificates, my work experiences,
my skills and my interests. This would make it easier for companies to know more about me and contact me if i meet their job requirements.
 
## Design Process
 
For my design, I wanted my website to have each section in a rectangle box. This makes my design neat and easier to read. When companies are looking to hire me, they are
able to easily see my information withn ease. This allows them to quickly decide whether i meet their job requirements. The buttons at the top of my website also make it
easier for the users to navigate the website.

As a manager looking to hire an employee, I would want to know the potential employee well so that i can decide if he meets the job requirements.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
