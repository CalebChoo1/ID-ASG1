        <p1 class="boxed">My name is Caleb Choo and I am a curious, determined and persevering person. I would be constantly asking 
        questions<br> like 'what if?', 'why?', ''how?' and I would not give up until I found my answer. I am curious to 
        know how computers and<br> phones are able to store all my information while keeping it safe and confidential.
        I am looking forward to learning more<br> about programming and cyber security from my lecturers.<br><br> In the future
        I would like to become a Software Engineer or a Cybersecurity Analyst. I have seen many Software Engineers
        in-action and their softwares are brilliant! Personally, I would like to develop a useful software to 
        bring convenience to<br> the lives of others. Working as a cybersecurity analyst would also be ideal as i am 
        a very curious person. In the event<br> where a data breach occurs, I would like to get to the bottom of the 
        incident and how it occured in the first place. With<br> my determination, I will work hard to pursue one of 
        these careers.</p>

        <p2>During the holidays, I assisted my family's online business by<br> identifying popular products and recommending 
          them to be<br> marketed. I learned how to price the products reasonably in<br> order for 
          the business to be profitable. Additionally, I also<br> made some simple designs for mugs and 
          t-shirts. I feel that<br> learning these techniques will definately aid my financial<br> situation in the 
          future since online marketing can serve as<br> an external source of income.</p2>

        <p3>I enjoy sports a lot! I play badminton and basketball with<br> my friends 
        or family in my free time. This year, I decided to<br> join the canoeing team as I have paddled 
        before and it was<br> such an enjoyable experience even though I had a slight<br> difficulty in
        balancing the boat. I also enjoy watching<br> Netflix movies or shows  in my free time! I usually watch<br> crime 
        dramas but nowadays, I watch Korean dramas as<br> well! Due  to the recent covid-19 
        restrictions, I have<br> encountered many exciting movies and shows!</p3>
