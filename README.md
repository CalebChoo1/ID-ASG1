This website is made to promote myself to companies when i am looking for a job in the future. It will contain information about me, my certificates, my work experiences,
my skills and my interests. This would make it easier for companies to know more about me and contact me if i meet their job requirements.
 
## Design Process
 
For my design, I wanted my website to have each section in a rectangle box. This makes my design neat and easier to read. When companies are looking to hire me, they are
able to easily see my information withn ease. This allows them to quickly decide whether i meet their job requirements. The buttons at the top of my website also make it
easier for the users to navigate the website.

As a manager looking to hire an employee, I would want to know the potential employee well so that i can decide if he meets the job requirements.
