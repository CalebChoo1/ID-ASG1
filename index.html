          <p1 class="boxed">My name is Caleb Choo and I am a curious, determined and persevering person. I would be constantly asking 
          questions<br> like 'what if?', 'why?', ''how?' and I would not give up until I found my answer. I am curious to 
          know how computers and<br> phones are able to store all my information while keeping it safe and confidential.
          I am looking forward to learning more<br> about programming and cyber security from my lecturers.<br><br> In the future
          I would like to become a Software Engineer or a Cybersecurity Analyst. I have seen many Software Engineers
          in-action and their softwares are brilliant! Personally, I would like to develop a useful software to 
          bring convenience to<br> the lives of others. Working as a cybersecurity analyst would also be ideal as i am 
          a very curious person. In the event<br> where a data breach occurs, I would like to get to the bottom of the 
          incident and how it occured in the first place. With<br> my determination, I will work hard to pursue one of 
          these careers.</p>

          font-weight: normal;">I enjoy sports a lot! I play badminton and basketball with my friends 
          or family in my free<br> time. This year, I decided to join the canoeing team as I have paddled 
          before and it was such<br> an enjoyable experience even though I had a slight difficulty in 
          balancing the boat. 
          
          I also enjoy<br> watching Netflix movies or shows  in my free time! I usually watch crime 
          dramas but nowadays,<br> I watch Korean dramas as well! Due  to the recent covid-19 
          restrictions, I have encountered many<br> exciting movies and shows!</p>
