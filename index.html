              <p>I am a curious, determined and persevering person. I would be constantly asking questions like<br> 'what if?', 'why?', ''how?' and I would not give up until i found my answer. I am curious to know<br> how computers and phones are able to store all my information while keeping it safe and confidential.<br> I am looking forward to learning more about programming and cyber security from my lecturers. </p>
